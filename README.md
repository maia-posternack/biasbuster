# BiasBuster: check your sources
*In today's age, fake news reigns. Even when you are getting your news from a "reliable" website, it is hard to know whether a specific author is reliable, or what baises affect them. BiasBuster is a chrome extension that scans an author's articles for key words, compiles user rating of where an article falls upon the "specturm", and provides a space for discourse, allowing users to get the "full story"* 

Note that this project was created in May 2021 before I had knowledge of dynamic programming, web-scraping, or nuanced APIs. I hope to return to it in the future to make it more robust.
